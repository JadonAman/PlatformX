🔍 Critical Issues to Address
1. Security & Authentication ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
✅ Done: Basic JWT authentication
❌ Missing:
Password strength requirements
Rate limiting on login endpoint (prevent brute force)
Token refresh mechanism (7-day tokens might be too long)
Session management (logout from all devices)
HTTPS enforcement in production
2. Error Handling & Logging ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
✅ Done: Basic error logging with Logger utility
❌ Issues:
Too many console.log statements (30+ matches) - should use proper logger
No centralized error handler for uncaught exceptions
No monitoring/alerting system
Build system errors not properly surfaced to users
3. Git Import Feature ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
❌ Found TODO: Line 387 in gitImport.js says "TODO: Implement git pull logic"
❌ Missing:
Update/redeploy from Git (pull latest changes)
Webhook support for auto-deploy on push
Git credentials management for private repos
SSH key support
4. Build System ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
❌ Missing:
Build progress feedback to user
Build timeout handling (currently 10 min, could hang)
Build cancellation feature
Build logs visible in UI
Pre-build and post-build hooks
5. Frontend Apps Support ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
✅ Done: Basic static serving and proxy
❌ Missing:
Environment variables for frontend builds (e.g., REACT_APP_*)
Custom build commands (not just npm run build)
Multiple build configurations (dev/prod)
Asset optimization (gzip, caching headers)
6. Database Management ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
✅ Done: Per-app MongoDB databases
❌ Missing:
Database backup/restore functionality
Database migration tools
Connection pooling configuration
Database size limits per app
7. Resource Limits & Quotas ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
❌ Critical Missing:
CPU/Memory limits per app (currently unlimited!)
Request rate limiting per app
Storage quotas (apps folder can grow infinitely)
Max number of apps per platform
Build time limits enforcement
8. Monitoring & Analytics ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY
✅ Done: Request counter
❌ Missing:
Response time tracking
Error rate monitoring
App health checks
Resource usage statistics
Uptime tracking
9. Documentation ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
❌ Missing:
README.md (main project documentation)
API documentation
Deployment guide
Architecture diagram
User guide for deploying apps
Contributing guidelines
10. Testing ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
❌ Critical Missing:
Unit tests
Integration tests
E2E tests
Test coverage
CI/CD pipeline
11. App Management UI ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
✅ Done: Basic CRUD, logs, env vars
❌ Missing:
Build button for frontend apps (rebuild without reupload)
App settings page (proxy config, build settings)
Bulk operations (delete multiple apps)
App cloning/duplication
App export/import
12. Deployment Features ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY
❌ Missing:
Rollback to previous version
Blue-green deployments
Deployment history
Scheduled deployments
Deployment approvals
13. Performance ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
❌ Issues:
No caching layer (Redis)
No CDN support for static files
No lazy loading optimization
File watcher might cause high CPU usage
Unload idle apps (15 min) might be too short
14. File Management ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
❌ Missing:
Cleanup old ZIP uploads from /uploads/tmp
Max file size configuration
Compression support beyond ZIP (tar.gz, etc.)
File browser in dashboard
15. Validation & Constraints ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY
✅ Done: Basic slug validation, forbidden patterns
❌ Missing:
App name reserved words (e.g., "api", "admin", "www")
File extension whitelist/blacklist
Dependency vulnerability scanning
Code quality checks
📋 Recommended Priority Action Items
Immediate (This Week):
Add README.md - Critical for project understanding
Implement resource limits - Prevent DOS/abuse
Add rate limiting - Protect authentication
Clean up console.log - Use proper logging
Add error boundaries - Better error handling
Short-term (Next 2 Weeks):
Complete Git pull/update feature
Add build progress UI
Implement app health checks
Add database backups
Create API documentation
Medium-term (Next Month):
Add unit tests - Critical for stability
Implement rollback feature
Add monitoring dashboard
Support private Git repos
Add webhook support
Optional/Future:
Multi-tenancy (different users)
Team collaboration features
Custom domains support
SSL/TLS certificate management
Docker container support
Would you like me to start implementing any of these? I'd recommend starting with:

README.md - Document what we've built
Resource limits - Critical security issue
Rate limiting - Protect the platform


SSL/HTTPS support
Resource limits per app
Multi-user/RBAC
Phase 2 (Developer Experience):
4. Real-time logs streaming
5. Database management UI
6. CI/CD integration

Phase 3 (Production Ready):
7. Custom domains
8. Health checks & auto-restart
9. Monitoring & alerts

Phase 4 (Scale):
10. App scaling & load balancing
11. Docker support
12. Inter-app networking
